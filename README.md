# DDPrism: A Data-Driven Prism

**DDPrism** is a JAX-based framework for solving multi-view source separation problems. It iteratively learns diffusion model priors which enable direct sampling from the joint posterior without making any explicit source assumptions. More details on the problem, the method, and the results can be found in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY).
